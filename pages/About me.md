## Research Experience

### Reinforcement Learning and Subgame Solving for Incomplete Information Pursuit-Evasion Game (2022/11 -- 2023/06)

- Discretized the pursuit-evasion game dynamics and action space, representing simultaneous action selection using information sets.
- Trained a neural network using reinforcement learning to evaluate state values.
- Utilized the CFR-D algorithm to solve for equilibrium in extended-form Subgames.

### Cooperative Task Assignment for Multi-Agent System (2022/03 -- 2022/09)

- Developed an optimal model for cooperative task assignment under time window constraints.
- Proposed the CBAA-TWC algorithm, a consensus-based auction algorithm addressing task assignment under time window constraints.
- Implemented a discrete time-varying price-increasing auction mechanism with individual rationality.

### Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Fire Tracking (2021/09 -- 2022/03)

- Modeled fire propagation, quadcopter movement, and observations.
- Designed a reward function considering observation coverage and fire development trends.
- Employed mean-field representation to capture communication interactions among multiple agents and applied reinforcement learning to learn the Q-function.
