# Paper Reading 13  Retrieval-Augmented Generation for  AI-Generated Content: A Survey

# 论文信息

Retrieval-Augmented Generation for  AI-Generated Content: A Survey



# 个人总结

本文是一篇综述，介绍了 RAG 在多个领域的应用，包括文本， Code,  结构性文本（也就是文中提到的 konwledge，包括表格和图结果），图像，视频，音频等。

文中将RAG结构划分为 retrieval 和 generator 两部分，而从RAG 中 retrieval 和 generator 的结合方式，分为了四种 分别是 query RAG ，Latent Representation-Based RAG，

其中 query RAG 是我们最熟悉的RAG 模式，就是根据 qury 检索到一些内容，然后把query 和  检索到的结果一起给 generator 生成最终结果，这是文本的结合

Latent Representation-Based RAG 是实现了 query 和 检索结果 在特征向量层面的结果

Logit-based RAG 这个好像很奇怪，我应该看一下相关论文再来看一下，结合典型代表knn-LM的论文一看就很清楚了，这里的结合是在最终结果输出之前的一部，将参考答案结合生成答案作为最后的输出概率。

Speculative是使用 retrieval 来代替一些 generator的过程



对于不同的 RAG提升方式分为了 input enhancement, retrieval enhancement, generator enhancement,  result enhancement 和 pipeline enhancement 。 这种划分方法和之前的另一篇综述*（[Paper Reading 8 LLM-IR(Information Retrieval) — 英飞](https://zuti666.github.io/2024/11/29/Paper-Reading-Note-8-LLM-Information-Retrieval-IR/)）的划分是大体一致的  ，但是这里没有提到 rerank 的概念。 我也是问了一下 gpt, 回答大概就是 retrieval 一般指 document retrieval 找的相关的内容，而 rerank 而是根据检索到的内容进行精细的排序，增加准确性。



文章的另一个主打点就是 介绍了RAG在各种不同领域的应用，但在不同的领域RAG起到的作用是类似的， 

一个主要功能就是搜索相关知识，填充generator 所缺乏的知识空白，也就是 Knowledge Gap Bridging， 这可以理解为从0到1，为generator 提供必不可少的支持。另一个角度看就是 增强结果的全面性，使得结果描述更加丰富，可以理解为从10到100，让回答更加全面。 这两个角度也就是为什么可以RAG可以应用到各种不同的领域，既是必不可缺的，又能提高效果、

还有一个就是 可以提供模板和示例，使得回答更加有组织。除此之外，还能在图像和视频领域，对齐文本和图像提供丰富的多模态信息，

其中在图像领域的应用是很有意思的，因为CLIP之后的图像生成，很多都是需要以来文本提示词来控制图像生成结果，而这些文本图像对也能进行检索，从未为图像生成最终结果提供很多参考。

一个例子如下

## Why RAG Divide into Retrieval and Generation

The authors categorize the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** structure into two core modules: **retrieval** and **generation**, forming the foundation of the RAG process. This division reflects the fundamental workflow and dependencies of RAG systems:

### **1. Why Divide into Retrieval and Generation?**

1. **Modular Design:**
   - Retrieval and generation serve distinct purposes, making this division natural and logical.
   - Retrieval focuses on identifying and supplying relevant information from external data sources.
   - Generation uses this retrieved data to produce coherent and contextually accurate outputs.
2. **Task Specialization:**
   - **Retrievers** excel at finding relevant objects from large-scale repositories, typically leveraging techniques like sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) or dense retrieval (e.g., ANN-based methods).
   - **Generators** specialize in synthesizing the retrieved knowledge into meaningful content, using models such as transformers, LSTMs, or diffusion models.
3. **Alignment with Workflow:**
   - RAG's entire pipeline revolves around the interaction between these two components:
     1. **Retrieval:** Extract relevant data based on input queries.
     2. **Generation:** Incorporate the retrieved data to create responses.
4. **General Applicability:**
   - This two-part structure allows flexibility and adaptability across various modalities (e.g., text, images, audio) while maintaining a unified framework.

------

### **2. How Are Retrieval and Generation Characterized?**

- **Retrieval:**
  - Focuses on locating external knowledge through specific similarity functions or indices.
  - Categorized into methods like sparse, dense, or specialized retrieval (e.g., using knowledge graphs or NER-based techniques).
- **Generation:**
  - Converts retrieved knowledge into desired outputs using generative models.
  - Adaptable to task requirements, whether text-to-text, text-to-image, or other modalities.

------

### **3. Rationale for Not Adding More Modules**

The two-part division aligns with the RAG process's core objective: **to combine external knowledge retrieval with content generation.** While there are additional steps, such as preprocessing, enhancement, and postprocessing, these are seen as **enhancements** rather than core functionalities, and thus they do not define separate modules.

This simplicity also ensures that RAG systems are modular, scalable, and interpretable across diverse applications and domains.

## **Logit-Based RAG: Overview, Concept, Representative Methods, and Distinction**

------

### **1. What Does Logit-Based RAG Represent?**

Logit-based RAG integrates retrieval into the generation process at the **logit level**, where logits represent the unnormalized probabilities for each token or output in a generative model. Instead of directly influencing the input or intermediate latent representations, this approach modifies or combines the logits of the generator with those derived from retrieval results.

------

### **2. Basic Idea of Logit-Based RAG**

- **Core Concept:**
  - During generation, retrieved information is integrated into the model by modifying or combining the logits of the generator at each decoding step.
  - This approach provides **fine-grained control** over the generative process by influencing token probabilities directly.
- **How It Works:**
  1. Retrieve relevant data (e.g., text snippets or code examples) based on the input query.
  2. Compute logits from the retrieved data (e.g., similarity scores, token probabilities from a language model).
  3. Combine these logits with the generator’s logits, using methods like weighted summation or confidence-based merging.
  4. Generate the final output based on the adjusted logits.
- **Advantages:**
  - Directly impacts the generation probabilities, improving alignment with retrieved knowledge.
  - Well-suited for sequence-based tasks, especially those requiring step-by-step generation.

------

### **3. Representative Methods**

#### **3.1 kNN-LM**

- Overview:
  - Uses a nearest neighbor search to retrieve tokens from an external datastore and combines their logits with those from the generator.
- How It Works:
  - A key-value datastore is built from the training corpus, where each token and its context are stored.
  - During generation, the model retrieves the nearest neighbors for the current context and computes logits based on their similarity scores.
  - Combines these logits with the generator’s logits to guide the next token prediction.
- Applications:
  - Text generation, especially in scenarios requiring long-tail knowledge or rare token prediction.

![image-20250104163743114](https://zuti.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/img/20250104163743279.png)

#### **3.2 TRIME**

- Overview:
  - Enhances kNN-LM by jointly training the retrieval system and the generator for improved synergy.
- How It Works:
  - Retrieval results are used to dynamically adjust the logits during training, ensuring alignment between the retrieval and generation components.
- Applications:
  - Long-tail QA and sequence generation tasks requiring rare or unseen contexts.

#### **3.3 EDITSUM**

- Overview:
  - Applies logit-level integration in code summarization by combining logits from retrieved summaries with those generated by the model.
- How It Works:
  - Retrieved code-summary pairs contribute logits that are combined with the generative logits, improving alignment with existing examples.
- Applications:
  - Code summarization and domain-specific text generation.

------

### **4. Differences Between Logit-Based RAG and Other RAG Types**

| **Aspect**                 | **Logit-Based RAG**                           | **Query-Based RAG**                   | **Latent Representation-Based RAG**        | **Speculative RAG**                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Integration Stage**      | Logit level (generation step)                 | Input stage (before generation)       | Latent space (intermediate model states)   | Replaces parts of generation with retrieval |
| **Focus**                  | Fine-grained control over token probabilities | Augments the model’s input            | Enhances comprehension in latent space     | Improves efficiency and speed               |
| **Use Case**               | Rare token prediction, sequence-based tasks   | Open-domain QA, summarization         | Long-context tasks, cross-modal generation | Low-latency applications                    |
| **Complexity**             | Requires retrieval-logit integration          | Simpler, relies on input augmentation | Demands alignment in latent space          | Requires minimal generator modifications    |
| **Representative Methods** | kNN-LM, TRIME, EDITSUM                        | REALM, DPR+BART, IC-GAN               | FiD, RETRO, ReMoDiffuse                    | REST, GPTCache                              |

------

### **5. Key Takeaways**

- **Core Innovation:** Logit-based RAG directly adjusts the generative process by modifying token probabilities, offering granular control over the output.
- **Strengths:** Effective for tasks requiring rare token prediction or long-tail distribution handling.
- **Challenges:** Logit integration can be computationally intensive and requires careful design to balance retrieval and generation probabilities.
- **Comparison:** Unlike query-based or latent representation-based RAG, logit-based methods operate at the decoding stage, allowing real-time influence on token selection. This makes it uniquely suited for sequence-driven applications.

  - Videos combine spatial, temporal, and multimodal data, making retrieval and generation more complex.
  - Example:
    - **Video QA:** Requires integration of temporal reasoning, visual embeddings, and textual retrieval.
    - **Image QA:** Primarily involves visual-text alignment.
    - **Text QA:** Relies on document retrieval without spatial or temporal reasoning.

#### **2.3 Retrieval Input and Database**

- Text:
  - Input: Textual queries or sentences.
  - Database: Document collections, knowledge bases.
- Image:
  - Input: Visual embeddings, textual prompts.
  - Database: Image-caption pairs, visual datasets.
- Video:
  - Input: Video frame features, textual queries, temporal embeddings.
  - Database: Video-caption datasets, motion templates, event sequences.

#### **2.4 Task Granularity**

- **Text:** Focused on precise reasoning or synthesis (e.g., QA, summarization).
- **Image:** Enriches descriptive or generative tasks (e.g., captioning, generation).
- **Video:** Expands into temporal tasks (e.g., future prediction, grounded dialogue).

#### **2.5 Output Complexity**

- **Text:** Outputs are typically structured or concise (e.g., answers, summaries).
- **Image:** Outputs are visual or descriptive (e.g., captions, generated images).
- **Video:** Outputs involve temporal alignment, often requiring dynamic descriptions or event predictions.
